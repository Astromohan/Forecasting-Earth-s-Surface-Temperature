# Forecasting-Earth-s-Surface-Temperature

<b>About the Data:</b><br>
This dataset contains 113 years of climate change observations from across the globe (Dataset source Berkeley Earth data page).Dataset includes the following columns:
1. Date – It is range of date between the year 1900 to 2012
2. Average Temperature – Global average temperature in Celsius
3. Average Temperature Uncertainty – Error value of thermometer (For example if my thermometer reading fluctuates between 20.12 to 20.18, I can conclude my uncertainty would be 0.06)
4. City – Consists of the city name where the weather change occurred.
5. Country – Contains the country name
6. Latitude – Gives the latitude values
7. Longitude – Gives the longitude values

<b>Aim of the project:</b><br>
To perform exporatory analysis and forecasting methods like Naive, Seasonal Naive and ARIMA model on cleaned data and finding the best forecasting model among the three models based on their accuracy.
